**Suggestion**: TASKS.md functionality for active task management  
**Details**: Proposed the idea of a CURRENT_TASK module that could track ongoing work within project phases, preserve context between Claude sessions, and document findings, complications, errors, and approaches. This suggestion led to the implementation of TASKS.md as the 13th documentation module, providing session continuity and better context preservation for interrupted work.
