### Clarified README Examples vs Actual Dependencies
- **What**: Added clear labeling that Tech Stack examples are hypothetical, not Claude Conductor's deps
- **Why**: User confusion - examples looked like actual Claude Conductor dependencies
- **How**: Renamed section to "How Your Project's ARCHITECTURE.md Will Look" and added explicit notes
- **Issues**: None
- **Result**: Clear distinction that React/Express/etc are examples, Claude Conductor only uses Commander, fs-extra, glob, and chalk

### Refactored Security Scanning to CLI Command
- **What**: Changed security scanning from CLAUDE.md toggle to explicit CLI command
- **Why**: User feedback - more obvious control and explicit user action required
- **How**: Added `vuln-scan` subcommand to CLI that generates Claude Code prompts
- **Issues**: None - cleaner separation of concerns
- **Result**: Users now run `npx claude-conduct vuln-scan` to generate security scan prompts

### CLI Command Structure Update
- **What**: Restructured CLI to support multiple commands (init, vuln-scan)
- **Why**: Better extensibility for future commands
- **How**: Used commander.js subcommands with init as default
- **Issues**: None

### Security Scanning Feature Implementation
- **What**: Added optional security scanning feature to CLAUDE.md with toggle control
- **Why**: Help users identify critical security vulnerabilities without being intrusive
- **How**: Added Security Scanning section with CONDUCTOR_SECURITY_SCAN toggle (enabled/disabled)
- **Issues**: None - feature is informational only and never modifies code
- **Result**: Claude can now perform periodic security scans branded as "ConductorðŸª„ is scanning for vulnerabilities"

### Security Scan Checks Include:
- Exposed .env files or API keys in code
- Unsafe innerHTML usage (XSS risk)
- Missing .gitignore entries for sensitive files
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Common security anti-patterns

### GitHub Pages Setup and Documentation Updates
- **What**: Set up GitHub Pages for privacy/terms pages and updated documentation
- **Why**: Provide accessible legal pages and improve project documentation
- **How**: Configured docs/ directory with index.html, privacy.html, and terms.html
- **Issues**: None - pages ready for GitHub Pages activation
- **Result**: Complete static site ready for deployment via GitHub Pages settings

### Shorthand Command Fix
- **What**: Fixed CLI shorthand from `claude-c` to `claude-conduct` throughout docs
- **Why**: Incorrect shorthand would cause command not found errors for users
- **How**: Updated README.md and all references to use correct `claude-conduct` command
- **Issues**: Found typos like "claude-conductonductor" in several places
- **Result**: Consistent and correct command usage documentation

### Security Health Check Feature
- **What**: Added security vulnerability scanning to setup instructions
- **Why**: Help users identify common security issues early in development
- **How**: Updated both Option 1 and Option 2 setup prompts to include security checks
- **Issues**: None - instructions clearly state to only list issues, not fix them
- **Result**: Users now prompted to check for exposed .env files, API keys, missing .gitignore entries, etc.

### Privacy Policy URL Fix
- **What**: Fixed documentation website URL formatting in PRIVACY.md
- **Why**: Plain text URL wasn't clickable in rendered markdown
- **How**: Converted to proper markdown link format
- **Issues**: None
- **Result**: Clickable link to documentation website in privacy policy

### Journal System Clarification
- **What**: Added Journal Update Requirements section to CLAUDE.md
- **Why**: User expected automatic journal updates but system requires manual prompts
- **How**: Added clear requirements for when/how to update JOURNAL.md
- **Issues**: Journal wasn't being updated frequently enough
- **Result**: Clear guidance for maintaining development history
